This project automates the building and publication of Java Buildpack dependency artifacts.

## Replicating Repository
To host the Java Buildpack dependency artifacts on your own server, first download the artifacts and `index.yml` files as described below, make them available at suitable locations on a web server, and then fork the Java buildpack and update its [repository configuration](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/util-repositories.md#configuration) to point at the web server.

All the artifacts and `index.yml` files may be downloaded using the [`replicate`](bin/replicate) script.

To use the script, issue the following commands from the root directory of a clone of this repository:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec bin/replicate [--base-uri <BASE-URI> | --host-name <HOST-NAME>] --output <OUTPUT>
```

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `-b`, `--base-uri <BASE-URI>` | A URI to replace `https://download.run.pivotal.io` with, in `index.yml` files.  This value should be the network location that the repository is replicated to (e.g. `https://internal-repository:8000/dependencies`).  Either this option or `--host-name`, but not both, **must** be specified.
| `-h`, `--host-name <HOST-NAME>` | A host name to replace `download.run.pivotal.io` with, in `index.yml` files.  This value should be the network host that the repository is replicated to (e.g. `internal-repository`).  Either this option or `--base-uri`, but not both, **must** be specified.
| `-o`, `--output <OUTPUT>` | A filesystem location to replicate the repository to.  This option **must** be specified.

## Building Dependencies
To run the builder, issue the following commands from the root directory of a clone of this repository:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec bin/build [DEPENDENCY] [OPTIONS]
```

### Configuration File
All components require a configuration file in order to be published.  This YAML file contains credentials for various servers used during publishing.  If unspecified with the `--configuration` switch, it is expected to be at `~/.java_buildpack_dependency_builder.yml`.  An example file looks like the following:

```yaml
---
# Values are for default repository
:bucket: download.pivotal.io
:repository_root: https://download.run.pivotal.io

# Required AWS credentials
:access_key_id: <ACCESS_KEY_ID>
:secret_access_key: <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

# Optional CloudFront Distribution Id
:distribution_id: <DISTRIBUTION_ID>

# Optional AppDynamics download credentials
:app_dynamics_username: <USERNAME>
:app_dynamics_password: <PASSWORD>
```

| Key | Description
| --- | -----------
| `:access_key_id` | AWS Access Key Id for the destination bucket and optional CloudFront distribution
| `:app_dynamics_password` | **(Optional)** AppDynamics agent download password
| `:app_dynamics_username` | **(Optional)** AppDynamics agent download username
| `:bucket` | Publishing destination S3 bucket
| `:distribution_id` | **(Optional)** The CloudFront distribution id for the destination bucket
| `:respository_root` | The repository root URI that dependencies will be available at
| `:secret_access_key` | AWS Secret Access Key for the destination bucket and optional CloudFront distribution


_Pivotal employees should contact Ben Hale for AWS and AppDynamics credentials if they have not already been issued and are needed._

### Building Node, OpenJDK, and Ruby
In order to build Node, OpenJDK, and Ruby you will need [Vagrant][] and [VirtualBox][] or [VMware Fusion][].  Follow the default installation instructions for these applications.  If you choose to use VMware Fusion, make sure that you also have a license for, and have installed the [Vagrant VMware Provider][].

```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-fusion
$ vagrant plugin license vagrant-vmware-fusion license.lic
```
